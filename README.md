As it was recommended by redux itself  to use redux toolkit I redeveloped it with redux toolkit. 
2- In second part value is being change in one child and it could be used in its sibling again using redux toolkit. So the state has different values in this program.
3- value is being changed in child3 and by clicking the butoon it is shown in parent component. It is using a function as a prop in child
